### Overview
We analyzed temperature data speficially for June and December to ensure that the idea of a combination surf shop and ice cream parlor is something that could be utilized and could be as successful as a [combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ8ViYIeH04) is.<br>

As we can see from the data gathered:
- The mean temperature only varies slightly when comparing June & December
- While the minimum temperature in December is about 8 degrees lower than the minimum temperature in June, it is likely that surfers would still utilize the shop even if ice cream sales declined some on those "colder" days
- It's safe to assume that the few extra degrees in the maximum temperature in June is the time when ice cream sales will sky rocket

### Summary
A combination surf and ice cream shop in Oahu is sure to do well but before branching out to other locations it may prove useful to gather and analyze data on the following:
- The wind conditions can play a large part in the discouragement of surfing so it is something to consider.
- The proximity to hotels, resorts or other lodging could be beneficial to the ice cream aspect of the business as tourism would like be a factor to consider.
